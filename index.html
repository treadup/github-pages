<h1>github-drone-github-pages</h1>

<p>This project is an example of how to deploy a web site to GitHub pages
using the drone.io service.</p>

<h2>Deployment key</h2>

<p>For drone to be able to authenticate against GitHub you have to create
a deployment key. This is done using the ssh-keygen command. Add the
private key as a secret in Drone. Add the public key as a deployment
key for the target repo in GitHub. Make sure that you give the
deployment key push access when creating it in the GitHub user interface.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>

<p>The deployed site can be accessed using the
<a href="https://treadup.github.io/github-pages/">https://treadup.github.io/github-pages/</a>
url.</p>
